# Minipart

Minipart is a project of open source graph and hypergraph partitioner.
It is currently in its infancy and does not provide partitioning algorithms yet.

## Goals
* Publish an open source partitioner (MLPart is open source, but it's focused on EDA and not widely available)
* Enhance the state of the art (hopefully)
* Explore partitioning algorithms for integration in generic optimization solvers
