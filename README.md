# Minipart

Minipart is a graph and hypergraph partitioner. It accepts the [hMetis hypergraph format](http://glaros.dtc.umn.edu/gkhome/fetch/sw/hmetis/manual.pdf).

Minipart is still in its infancy: it is under active development, focused on solution quality and runtime performance.
Please consider it alpha quality.

## Goals

* Publish an open source partitioner (for another open-source partitioner, see [MLPart](http://vlsicad.eecs.umich.edu/BK/PDtools/))
* Enhance the state of the art (hopefully)
* Explore partitioning algorithms for integration in generic optimization solvers

## Name

Minipart is named after [Minisat](http://minisat.se/), the well-known SAT solver. I am not related in any ways to Minisat's authors, but I learned a lot through their codebase and research.
